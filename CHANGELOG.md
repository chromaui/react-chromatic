# 0.7.6 - 2017-12-19

- Fix an issue where we did not pass the context to stories in the right format.

# 0.7.5 - 2017-12-19

- We detect a running process on your app's port and don't try and start the app if so. Pass `--do-not-start` if you've already started the app.

# 0.7.3 - 2017-12-09

- We now upload your application bundle to our tunnel server directly from the package.
  This means that on slower uplinks, we no need to set arbitrary timeouts in our server process; instead we simply will not start your Chromatic build until we've verified the bundle has uploaded successfully.
