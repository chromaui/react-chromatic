# 0.7.3 - 2017-12-09

- We now upload your application bundle to our tunnel server directly from the package.
  This means that on slower uplinks, we no need to set arbitrary timeouts in our server process; instead we simply will not start your Chromatic build until we've verified the bundle has uploaded successfully.
